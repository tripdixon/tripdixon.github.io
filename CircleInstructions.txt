Solutions Engineer Technical Assessment
Please complete the following tasks and provide us with your responses. Ideally, responses will
be provided as a functioning live example. The expectation is not that you will write the most
efficient code or that you provide a perfect solution, but rather that we can get an understanding
of your command of programming concepts and your familiarity with the technologies used. If
you cannot complete any of the questions using code, please write out how you would solve the
problem and where you got stuck.

1. Create a function that logs “Hello World” to the console every 10 seconds.

2. Create a function that sets a cookie with an initial value of 0 on the page. Each time on
the page loads, add 1 to the cookie’s value and log it to the console. For example, the
value of the cookie would be 1 on the first page load, 2 on the second load, etc. Extra
Credit: On the page, create a button that resets the cookie’s value to 0 when clicked.

3. Using Lucidchart or a similar diagramming tool, please draw out the logical flow of the
function in Question 2.
